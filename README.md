Ever wanted to find the middle letter to a word or sentence? Look no further than here!

By inputting a string without spaces or letters, a middle letter can be defined. This is simple enough when the chosen input has an odd amount of letters. The middle of a 5-letter word would be the 3rd (12 3 45). But a middle letter is not available when there is an even input (1 23 4). 

By giving each letter a phonetical representation I have laid out a way to find the middle letter even if there is an even input.
